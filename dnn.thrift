# Thrift Tutorial
# Mark Slee (mcslee@facebook.com)
#
# This file aims to teach you how to use Thrift, in a .thrift file. Neato. The
# first thing to notice is that .thrift files support standard shell comments.
# This lets you make your thrift file executable and include your Thrift build
# step on the top line. And you can place comments like this anywhere you like.
#
# Before running this file, you will need to have installed the thrift compiler
# into /usr/local/bin.

/**
 * The first thing to know about are types. The available types in Thrift are:
 *
 *  bool        Boolean, one byte
 *  byte        Signed byte
 *  i16         Signed 16-bit integer
 *  i32         Signed 32-bit integer
 *  i64         Signed 64-bit integer
 *  double      64-bit floating point value
 *  string      String
 *  binary      Blob (byte array)
 *  map<t1,t2>  Map from one type to another
 *  list<t1>    Ordered list of one type
 *  set<t1>     Set of unique elements of one type
 *
 * Did you also notice that Thrift supports C style comments?
 */

// Just in case you were wondering... yes. We support simple C comments too.

/**
 * Thrift files can reference other Thrift files to include common struct
 * and service definitions. These are found using the current path, or by
 * searching relative to any paths specified with the -I compiler flag.
 *
 * Included objects are accessed using the name of the .thrift file as a
 * prefix. i.e. shared.SharedObject
 */
// include "shared.thrift"

/**
 * Thrift files can namespace, package, or prefix their output in various
 * target languages.
 */
namespace cpp dnn

/**
 * You can define enums, which are just 32 bit integers. Values are optional
 * and start at 1 if not supplied, C style again.
 */

/**
 * Structs are the basic complex data structures. They are comprised of fields
 * which each have an integer identifier, a type, a symbolic name, and an
 * optional default value.
 *
 * Fields can be declared "optional", which ensures they will not be included
 * in the serialized output if they aren't set.  Note that this requires some
 * manual management in some languages.

struct Work {
  1: list<double> data,
  2: string op
}

/**
 * Ahh, now onto the cool part, defining a service. Services just need a name
 * and can optionally inherit from another service using the extends keyword.
